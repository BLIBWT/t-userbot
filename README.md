# T-Userbot
A fast, easy to setup telegram userbot running Python 3 which uses the [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/) Library.

### Requirements
- Python 3.5 or above
- API ID and Hash from [Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/apps)
- Some basic knowledege (although you can usually mindlessly copy&paste from the docs)

### Documentation
We've made docs to help you to set-up the bot.
